## GPT3 Rocketlaunch ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸš€

```
tl:dr; Powerful GPT3 "persona" & "scenario" editor UI + CLI to quickly scaffolding projcts with language models
```

**[>> Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.md)**

Tool to get you up & running **fast** with **[gpt3-rocket](https://github.com/gpt3rocket)** & conversational agents

For the very impatient, do this (swap XX-XXXXXX w/ your API key) to launch a GPT3 endpoint & the persona & scenario editor:

```sh
npx rocketlaunch -k XX-XXXXXX
```

A: gpt3-rocketlaunch. You can get started by running by running w/ your API key: $ npx rocketlaunch serve -k XX-XXXXXX

Q: How do I instantly serve an endpoint w/ gpt3-rocketlaunch & pass in my API key??
A: $ npx rocketlaunch serve -k  XX-XXXXXXX

Q: What if I don't have npx?
A: $ npm install -g rocketlaunch && rocketlaunch serve -k XX-XXXXXXX

Q: what if I want to learn more about gpt3?

A: $ npx rocketlaunch serve -k XX-XXXXXXX

Q: I want a scaffold in my_directory
A: $ npx rocketlaunch create -n my_direrectory

Q: Make a server on port 4444
A: $ npx rocketlaunch -p 4444

Q: Make a project in folder abc with API key XX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
A: $ npx rocketlaunch create -k XX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -n abc

## Request

POST this to an endpoint on https://localhost:8080/chat:

```sh
npx rocketlaunch serve -p 8080 -k XX-XXXXXXXX
```

```json
{
  "samples": [
    [
      "How do I instantly serve an endpoint w/ gpt3-rocketlaunch & pass in my API key??",
      "$ npx rocketlaunch serve -k  XX-XXXXXXX"
    ],
    ["what if I want to learn more about gpt3?", "$ npx rocketlaunch learn"],
    [

Defaults to port 8000, pass credential with the `-k` flag

```sh
rocketlaunch serve -p 5555 -k XX-XXXXXXX
```

## Postman Collection

A collection of endpoints is available **[here](https://github.com/valgaze/gpt3rocketlaunch/blob/master/postman_collection.json)**

Instructions on how to import collection available **[here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)**

## Papers & resources

- **[GPT3 101 (deck)](https://gpt3.valgaze.com)**

- **[Resources (https://github.com/valgaze/gpt3-chat/blob/master/docs/resources.md)](https://github.com/valgaze/gpt3-chat/blob/master/docs/resources.md)**

## Todo

- Break template into own repo & download/clone w/ CLI rather than copying/moving

- Add "GPT3-lab" exerperience: predict some UI code & render it
